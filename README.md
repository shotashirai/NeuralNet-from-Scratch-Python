# Neural Network from scratch in Python
Build neural network from scratch in Python.

## Project Summary
Build multi layer neural network from scratch in Python without using existing machine learning libraries. This project aims to demonstrate my ability to write python code with a readable form and understanding about the principle of neural network/deep learning technique.

## Netowrk structure
Multi layer network (arbitary number of hidden layers)  
weight decay  
activation functions: ReLU or Sigmoid  
forward propagation/back propagation  
loss function: cross entropy loss.  

## Code
Main code: train_neuralnet.py  
Corresponding codes:  
- functions.py:  
- layers.py:  
- gradient.py:  
- preprocess_minist.py:  

## Task
Handwritten digit recognition in MNIST dataset.

## Todo (in progress)
Batch normalization, dropout, convolutional layer, optimization
